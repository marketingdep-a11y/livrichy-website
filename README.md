For demonstration purposes, the starter kit includes sample images from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/). 
If you choose to use these resources in a production environment, remember to provide appropriate attribution, which you can conveniently place in the footer.


### MAPBOX INTEGRATION
 
#### Obtain a Mapbox access token:

* Go to the Mapbox website (https://www.mapbox.com/) and create an account if you don't have one.
* Generate an access token from your Mapbox account dashboard. This token will be used to authenticate your requests to Mapbox services.

#### Add the Access Token to the .env file

* Open the `.env` file.
* Add this line `VITE_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=`.
* After the = sign, paste your Mapbox access token obtained in step 1.
* Save the .env file.

#### Usage

To use Mapbox with the Real Estate starter kit, follow these steps:

* Access the Statamic CP on your website.
* Depending on your desired usage:
  * To use Mapbox inside the `Properties Section`, navigate Globals -> Theme. Go to the Settings tab and enable the toggle for `Has Map`.
  * To use Mapbox inside the `Map Section`, navigate to the set and fill in the `Latitude` and `Longitude` inputs.

### Globals
Globals are efficiently organized into different themes for easy customization:

* General
  * Sitename – Update to your agency's name.
  * Logo – Replace the default Cloud logo with your agency's logo (SVG recommended for best resolution and scalability).
* Favicon
  * We've generated all necessary favicon files for you but using our placeholder logo. Update these with your branding for consistency across web browsers. Real Favicon Generator (https://realfavicongenerator.net/) was used to create these and note that a `site.webmanifest` file is dynamically generated.
* Footer
  * Logo Display – Choose whether to display your logo in the footer.
  * Copyright – Update with your agency’s legal information.
  * Description – Add a brief description or tagline for your agency.
* Sitemap
  * Collections – Select collections to be included in the sitemap (Pages and Posts are set by default).
  * Change Frequency – Advise search engines how often the sitemap should be re-crawled.
  * Priority – Indicate to search engines the relative importance of pages on your site.

### SEO
SEO tools are embedded in the page editing interface within the control panel. A dedicated SEO section for each listing ensures that your content is optimized for search engines. The provided Seotamic add-on makes it easy to adjust meta tags, including dynamically generated Open Graph images for improved social sharing:

* Meta
  * Title – Customize the title displayed in search engine results.
  * Title prepend/append – Add a prefix or suffix to the title, drawing from the general SEO settings.
  * Meta Description – Craft a compelling summary for search engine listings. If left blank, search engines will auto-generate a description.
  * Canonical URL – Automatically reflects the page’s URL, but can be customized if needed.
* Social
  * Open Graph Title/Description – Customize how your content appears when shared on social platforms such as Facebook.
  * Twitter Title/Description – Tailor how your content is presented on Twitter.
  * Image – If no specific image is set, a default image will be utilized for social sharing. 

For posts, our custom ViewModel `App\ViewModels\OgImage.php` dynamically generates an Open Graph image based on the Hero Image of a post, enhancing social media visibility. If a static Open Graph image is preferred for each post, this ViewModel can be removed from the `Posts` collection setup.

### Styling
TailwindCSS powers Real Estate's design system; you can alter the primary colors and fonts to curate distinctive styles.

## Fonts & Icons
Choose from a wide variety of integrated fonts and icons to further personalize and enhance the user interface.

## Compiling Assets
Make use of Laravel Vite for asset compilation:
* `npm install` - installs dependencies.
* `npm run dev` - development mode.
* `npm run build` - compiles for production.

## Commercial Use
Real Estate is a commercial starter kit - ensure you acquire a license via the [Statamic Marketplace](https://statamic.com/starter-kits/luckymedia/real-estate) before deploying it in your project.
